A first-person character controller with an FSM, inspired by the Thief games.

Made in the Godot engine.

Uses the light detection method from [The Dark Mod](https://www.thedarkmod.com/main/), as documented [here](https://forums.thedarkmod.com/index.php?/topic/18882-how-does-the-light-awareness-system-las-work/).

Uses footstep sounds from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/), specifically [this sound](https://freesound.org/people/Fission9/sounds/521590/)
